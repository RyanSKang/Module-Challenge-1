# <Module-Challenge-1>

## Description

The motivation of this project was to understand the importance of using meaningful semantics within our Index.html so that we can consolidate our CSS codes in an efficient manner. I did this project so I can become more efficient and avoid redundant work by making each line of code in our index.html more meaninful so the web application is still functional. Moreover, this project allowed me to understand the importance of semantics and how to utilize classes and unique ID's so I can apply them into my CSS consolidated (also to help me read my index.html easier when doing my CSS codes). Overall, I learned alot on saving time and work by putting more effort into my elements and semantics in my index.html and CSS. I was suprised that my CSS sheet was cut in half by just changing the semantics within my HTML. I also learned a little but of debugging when I had to fix one of the links in the navigation bar because it was missing an unique ID. I analyzed the problem and found the solution and applied my theory, thus the application is functional now.

## Usage


This application can be used to help consolidate your CSS codes by using the correct semantics in your index.html. After debugging one of the links in the navigation bar because it was missing a unique ID, now you can use the navigation bar to bring you to the intended sections within the website.
